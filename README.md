## App requirements

  - As a Marvel fan, I want to view a list of the most recently updated Marvel characters. 
  - As a Marvel fan, I want to click a character's name and see that character's thumbnail image in a lightbox centered on the page.
  - When I click a different character's name, that character's thumbnail should replace the previous one in that centered lightbox.
  - While data is loading, I should see a loading gif in place of my character list. 
  - **A character thumbnail should appear with a `view detail` link. Clicking on that link should take me to a detail page unique to the character**
