# Marvel Explorer: Reduxified

Note that the requirements haven't changed. Only the implementation will be different. 

## How to Run

  - `cd` into project 
  - `yarn install`
  - `yarn start`

## Learning Objectives
  
  - Understand and implement unidirectional data flow using Redux
  - Understand and implement "container-state", the practice of managing state of a React component tree via top-down communication from a stateful root node. 

## App requirements

  - As a Marvel fan, I want to view a list of the most recently updated Marvel characters. 
  - As a Marvel fan, I want to click a character's name and see that character's thumbnail image in a lightbox centered on the page.
  - When I click a different character's name, that character's thumbnail should replace the previous one in that centered lightbox.
  - While data is loading, I should see a loading gif in place of my character list.
